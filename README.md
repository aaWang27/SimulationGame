# SimulationGame
Currently, in emergency situations and in intensive care units, clinicians can make adjustments to medication dosage too abruptly, causing drastic changes in physiological parameters such as blood sugar, blood pressure, and oxygen content. Dr. Josh Broder, an emergency care physician at Duke University Hospital, is seeking a solution to this problem. Control algorithms have the potential to more effectively administer medications and reduce the workload of clinicians, but there does not exist a method for evaluating their performance. A successful software platform will help the emergency department determine whether computers or clinicians can administer medication in a more safe and efficient manner, allowing the emergency department to make more informed decisions on where to dedicate hospital resources. It may also reduce the impact of the doctor and nurse shortage that is affecting the United States. Potential users of this project include physicians and nurses who are treating patients that need medication to control their vitals.

One function of the project is to compare human and computer algorithm performance when delivering and adjusting medication for hospital patients who need stabilization of vitals. The project will need to allow analysis of human performance by providing quantitative measurements. Another function is to enable simulation of different physiological parameters and their responses to different medications.
